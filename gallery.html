      In 1889, the Italians signed the Treaty of Wuchale with then Negus[nb 2]
      Menelik of Shewa. The treaty ceded territories previously part of
      Ethiopia, namely the provinces of Bogos, Hamasien, Akele Guzai, Serae, and
      parts of Tigray. In return, Italy promised Menelik II continued rule,
      financial assistance and military supplies. A dispute later arose over the
      interpretation of the two versions of the document. The Italian-language
      version of the disputed Article 17 of the treaty stated that the Emperor
      of Ethiopia was obliged to conduct all foreign affairs through Italian
      authorities. This would in effect make Ethiopia a protectorate of the
      Kingdom of Italy. The Amharic version of the article however, stated that
      the Emperor could use the good offices of the Kingdom of Italy in his
      relations with foreign nations if he wished. However, the Italian
      diplomats claimed that the original Amharic text included the clause and
      that Menelik II knowingly signed a modified copy of the Treaty.[15] The
      Italian government decided on a military solution to force Ethiopia to
      abide by the Italian version of the treaty. As a result, Italy and
      Ethiopia came into confrontation, in what was later to be known as the
      First Italo-Ethiopian War. In December 1894, Bahta Hagos led a rebellion
      against the Italians in Akele Guzai, in what was then Italian controlled
      Eritrea. Units of General Oreste Baratieri's army under Major Pietro
      Toselli [it] crushed the rebellion and killed Bahta. The Italian army then
      occupied the Tigrayan capital, Adwa. In January 1895, Baratieri's army
      went on to defeat Ras Mengesha Yohannes in the Battle of Coatit, forcing
      Mengesha to retreat further south. By late 1895, Italian forces had
      advanced deep into Ethiopian territory. On 7 December 1895, Ras Makonnen
      Wolde Mikael, Ras Welle Betul and Ras Mengesha Yohannes commanding a
      larger Ethiopian group of Menelik's vanguard annihilated a small Italian
      unit at the Battle of Amba Alagi. The Italians were then forced to
      withdraw to more defensible positions in Tigray Province, where the two
      main armies faced each other. By late February 1896, supplies on both
      sides were running low. General Oreste Baratieri, commander of the Italian
      forces, knew the Ethiopian forces had been living off the land, and once
      the supplies of the local peasants were exhausted, Emperor Menelik II's
      army would begin to melt away. However, the Italian government insisted
      that General Baratieri act. The landscape of Adwa On the evening of 29
      February, Baratieri, about to be replaced by a new governor, General
      Baldissera, met with his brigadier generals Matteo Albertone, Giuseppe
      Arimondi, Vittorio Dabormida, and Giuseppe Ellena, concerning their next
      steps. He opened the meeting on a negative note, revealing to his
      brigadiers that provisions would be exhausted in less than five days, and
      suggested retreating, perhaps as far back as Asmara. His subordinates
      argued forcefully for an attack, insisting that to retreat at this point
      would only worsen the poor morale.[16] Dabormida exclaiming, "Italy would
      prefer the loss of two or three thousand men to a dishonorable retreat."
      Baratieri delayed making a decision for a few more hours, claiming that he
      needed to wait for some last-minute intelligence, but in the end announced
      that the attack would start the next morning at 9:00am.[17] His troops
      began their march to
